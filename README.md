# basicShoppingListCalculator

I've been thinking about groceries a lot, could you tell?

In short, this is a simple demonstration project in Python that calculates a price based on the amount of groceries you want in the store.
Initializing the prices of various miscelanneous items, the user is asked to input how many of each item they want (not before being told how much everything costs though, this is an honest store we're running).
Afterwards, the total cost of each item is calculated and used to calculate the total bill for their purchase, which the user is then shown.
Simple as that!
